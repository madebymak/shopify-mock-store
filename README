A mock snowboard Shopify Store based on the Boundless theme.
I added a few extra features to the theme such as:
- instagram feed via insta-feed app
- animated logo intro
- icon nav bar
- redid the product layout page

TODO:

DONE:
- change color on top nav (currently clear)
- build culture (about) page
- remove search bar in top nav
- disable hamburger menu btn
- put in title header for email sub
- make patch on home page smaller
- change top nav to look like original
- use smaller imgs for products page
- fill out product price and description
- change product nav bar to look like main page
- instagram gallery section (will have to mock as the shopify app needs profile key)
- make instagram gallery responsive
- animate logo on main page (scale large to regular)
- fill out footer with info
- add to cart button broken
- change product layout
- fix mobile view (elements getting cut off @ < 320px wide)
